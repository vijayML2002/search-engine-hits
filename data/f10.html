		Some schools offer remote access to their classes over the Internet. Online schools also can provide support to traditional schools, as in the case of the School Net Namibia.

		Some online classes also provide experience in a class, so that when people take them, they have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect, and even more classes provide High School/College credit allowing people to take the classes at their own pace. Many online classes cost money to take but some are offered free.

Internet-based distance learning programs are offered widely through many universities. Instructors teach through online activities and assignments.

 Online classes are taught the same as physically being in class with the same curriculum. The instructor offers the syllabus with their fixed requirements like any other class.

 Students can virtually turn their assignments in to their instructors according to deadlines. This being through via email or in the course webpage. 
 
 This allowing students to work at their own pace, yet meeting the correct deadline. Students taking an online class have more flexibility in their schedules to take their classes at a time that works best for them. 
 
 Conflicts with taking an online class may include not being face to face with the instructor when learning or being in an environment with other students. 
 
 Online classes can also make understanding the content difficult, especially when not able to get in quick contact with the instructor. 
 
 Online students do have the advantage of using other online sources with assignments or exams for that specific class. 
 
 Online classes also have the advantage of students not needing to leave their house for a morning class or worrying about their attendance for that class.

 Students can work at their own pace to learn and achieve within that curriculum.[21]

The convenience of learning at home has been a major attractive point for enrolling online. Students can attend class anywhere a computer can go â€“ at home, a library or while traveling internationally.

 Online school classes are designed to fit your needs, while allowing you to continue working and tending to your other obligations.[22]

 Online school education is divided into three subcategories: Online Elementary School, Online Middle School, Online High school.
