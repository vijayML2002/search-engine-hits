            The upcoming Maruti Suzuki car in India could be offered with a choice between a 1.0-litre three-cylinder K10 petrol engine and a 1.2-litre petrol engine. We will also get to see a whole lot of changes to the 2021 Maruti Suzuki Celerio's interior.
            We are one more day closer to getting to 2021 Maruti Suzuki Celerio's launch in India and, you know, getting to see this highly-anticipated upcoming car. Of course, the closer we get to the day, the more details will be leaked and, thus, make their way on to the interwebs. Today, we have come across a new video showing the upcoming Maruti Suzuki car's interior as well as exterior. Of course, this means we get to learn a lot more about the 2021 Celerio. Plenty has been said and discussed about the car's exterior, so we will focus on the new Celerio's interior for now. On with it, then.

The Maruti Celerio's interior in its 2021 avatar has received a complete overhaul. The list of changes includes an all-black interior colour theme, faux aluminum accents across the cabin, vertical AC vents flanking a new touchscreen console, auto engine start/stop, push button start/stop, etc. It may also be interesting to note that the steering wheel with the mounted controls as well as the instrument cluster seen on this upcoming Maruti Suzuki car have been borrowed from the Maruti Suzuki WagonR. 
We do not yet have access to the new Maruti Suzuki Celerio's dimensions; yet, we can be certain the upcoming car in India will be longer, taller, and wider and will also get a longer wheelbase than its predecessor. This growth in dimensions also means the upcoming hatchback car will also get a bigger and more spacious cabin.

The upcoming Maruti Suzuki car in India could be offered with a choice between a 1.0-litre three-cylinder K10 petrol engine and a 1.2-litre petrol engine. Like the engine options, the transmission options, i.e. a five-speed manual gearbox and a five-speed AMT, too will be borrowed from the Maruti Suzuki WagonR.
