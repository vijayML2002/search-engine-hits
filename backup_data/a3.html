            Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte was not happy with Sergio Reguilon’s positioning in the first half of the Europa Conference League game against Vitesse last night, according to a report in The Express.
            Reguilon started for Tottenham at left-wing-back against Vitesse at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last night.

It was Conte’s first match in charge of Spurs since replacing Nuno at the North London club this month.

Tottenham won 3-2.

While Spurs had Cristian Romero sent off in the second half, Vitesse ended the game with nine men.

The Express have reported that in the first half, Reguilon was getting an earful from Conte regarding his position.

According to the report, Conte was repeatedly telling the Spaniard to come wider and calling him right over to the touchline even when the ball was on the opposite wing.”
Reguilon played very advanced in his wing-back role.

The former Real Madrid left-back did not have a particularly great game on a personal level.

The 24-year-old dropped to left-back in the second half after the dismissal of Romero.

Reguilon did look comfortable as a left-back.

While Spurs won 3-2, defensively they were very disappointing.

Conte will have seen that, and him trying to help Reguilon in the first half tells us that he knows that he has to fix that.
