        <p>Antonio Conte is now up and running as Tottenham head coach following Thursday evening's 3-2 win over Vitesse Arnhem in the Europa Conference League.
            Only appointed in the hotseat just over 48 hours earlier, the Italian got the perfect response from his new players as they raced into a 3-0 lead inside the first 30 minutes.

In that period the team played some very good football to trouble their Dutch opponents but they allowed the Eredivisie side back into the game following some sloppy play at the back.

Later seeing Cristian Romero sent off in the second half for two bookable offences, Spurs really had to hold on to keep their lead but they were helped by the visitors receiving two red cards in the closing stages of the game.
Speaking to the media in his post-match press conference, the 52-year-old discussed the victory and stated the importance of his team holding on for all three points while "suffering".

"My first impression, a crazy game a crazy game because we were winning 3-0 and I think we were dominating the game, created many chances to score. Other goals," he claimed.

"Instead in 10 mins we conceded two goals. In that moment, we lost a bit of confidence. I think we have to work also in this aspects. But we should win, we should win, and we won. For sure.
"We risk in the second half after a red card to stay with 10 men, they tried to push us, and then I decided to change, to make three changes. because I have seen we have lost the balance. And at the end, I think we deserved to win because at the end we created many chances, more chances than Vitesse.
"But [people] who know me very well, [know that] I don’t like when this type of game, this crazy game, I call them a crazy game. I want a stable team, I want when there’s a possibility to kill opponent, you must kill.

"But for sure, my players showed me great commitment, great resilience, and I think this is a good aspect. I think this team needs to win also suffering. It was important today."

Seeing plenty of positives from the game, Conte will have also discovered some things that he wants the players to improve on over the coming weeks as he looks to get Tottenham challenging at the top once again.

The new head coach will certainly push his players to get the very best out of them and that was evident on the pitch after the game.

With his coaching team, which includes three fitness coaches, officially confirmed a few hours ahead of kick-off, one of the coaches tasked with improving the players' fitness, Gian Piero Ventrone, was really putting the unused substitutes and those who were introduced late on through their paces.
Although there appeared to be no sign of Davinson Sanchez, players such as Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso, Steven Bergwijn, Joe Rodon, Matt Doherty, Japhet Tanganga and Dele Alli were really made to work hard.

Setting up an area spanning the width of the penalty and about 20 yards in length, Ventrone had the players constantly running up and down at varying speeds for a good period of time.

He wasn't letting anyone ease off and that was clear from the amount of times he was shouting instructions very loudly at them.

This just wasn't a casual warm down that players may go through at the end of a match, Conte's fitness coach was very much working them incredibly hard to try and boost their fitness.

As the same will no doubt be happening on the training pitch at Hotspur Way, fans could be about to see the benefits of all the hard work on the pitch over the coming months.
